Space Camp - 

Waterfall vs agile
    Waterfall - sequential design process, each phase started and completed and then move onto next one, can't go back after done. Meticulous documentation. 
    Agile - develop software incrementally, work on small modules, design test deploy then get feedback, and redesign... allows for rapid change. Versions can be launched periodically
Waterfall needs the picture known at the start of the project

the agile manifesto
flat organization (watch out for power hides, loudes voice prevails, blurred boundaries)

UI/UX - user interface and user experience

EXTREME PROGRAMMING
    - TDD
    - Pair programming
    - MVP
lightewight, humanistic, discipline, software development
Developing is like driving, change
mentality of sufficiency
Values and Principles
    - communication
    - simplicity
    - feedback
    - courage

1. incremental planning     - user stories, break stories into tasks, plan release, develop integrate, test, release software, evaluate and iterate
2. small releases           - value, constant feedback, sense of accomplishment, quickly adapt to changing requirements
3. simple design            - enough to meet the requirements, fewest possible classes and methods, 
4. test first               - all features need tests first, 1. create unit tests, write code to meet the test
5. refactoring              - take suboptimal code and restructure to make it simple and maintainable
6  pair programming         - 2 people, programming and strategizing
7. continuous integration   - integration testing every few hours, cycle, programming - local tests - integrate (integration tests) - system tests
8. on-site customer         - 

User stories - INVEST 
    independent
    negotiable
    valuable
    estimable
    sized
    testable

    Linear weighting - 0,1,2,3

Platform One - deployment platform (seperate organization)
Continuous authority to operate, certificat to field, pipelines, security standards, 





Resources and Links in Confluence for Requesting hardware....

save the links, checkout the sites, devsec page ~80 pages, P1 survival guide, etc...

product talk = mattermost
other talk = slack
C# and Unity

Request hardware from space camp - Operates in windows environment (partitioned hard drive)


Space Cockpit = government version of PIGI 
    Aerospace visualization tool for space operations
    460th Space Wing commanded by Col Pepper. Delta 4

google calendar
morning standup, ipm, and retro
Mattermost channels
Slack channel




Get space camp hardware, but need Windows install on it.

Testing is through Jest






Anderson Pickney and Richard Hardy (shadow today) - Unity part


Jerimiah - server
Ryan and Zach - server connecting to client
Unified Data Library - where data is pulled from

AppModel - stores most of the satellite data on front end

shortcuts ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
f12 to go to document of a classes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Unity - has its own test runner, 
    write tests in unity, 
    linting (re-sharper) good syntax in code
    sonarcube (docker stuff) 

edit mode - tests run while game not playing
play mode - tests run while game is playing





private _someThing
protected  - backing field MaxSatCount .... protected should have it's own properties

field vs property
public is usually a property

Confluence - Claire

cycling through orbit states? different observations?
I is for interfaces
    interface can be put on anything
ex: public class Appmodel : Window
    Window has a public interface lskdjfasdlj : lsdfjlkj {}

show advances in launches (videos old to new), but why are our operators ....
show new operational software

21 Jan 2021 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

add personal access token (PAT)
and add SSH (bitbucket)

Kim Kruger is working on getting hardware setup

09:30 Douglas Jacob Ground Station stuff
	Big thing! - not 100% sure what would be usefull, what they need. 

    Stuff I'm already planning on fixing:

    making the tab header borders thinner & slightly more slanted
    reducing the contrast for non-selected tab header text
    grid row colors (these are our current ones in the Sat Info Window)
    spacing/padding (especially at the top of the Sensor Limits tab)
    Stuff you're more than welcome to give feedback on:

    should the wording in any tab headers or grids be changed?
    should the content in the Details or Sensor Limits tabs be reorganized to be easier to read?
    suggestions about how tabs look
    anything else not mentioned

Ground Stations
    - 1 Satellite view of all/select Ground
    - 1 site view of all/select satTimeline for visibility (by site and by sat)
    - Ability to generate reports (customizable)
    - TIZ (temporary inhibit zone)
    - conjunctions (multiple satellites)
    - scheduled outages 
    - toggle outage
    - adjust elevation mask (min)
    - visualization? line to sat when in view
    - 1 week future/past (scheduling)
    - obscura 

Data Distribution
    - Rest API
OpenAPI Docs
Schemas 



Get a new microphone (or connect headset)
Find AFSCN/ Comm site data on UDM
Draw.io of ground stations vs sensors/monitor stations and usage
look at https://unifieddatalibrary.com/storefront/#/dataDistribution?page=Rest%20API

f12 - jump to location 
shift f12 - show references
ctrl f12 - go to implementation
scripts attached to componenets = monobehavior
if doesn't inhereit (injected) data handling class = 
alt enter to bring in things (using ...) like ...

crtl r, ctrl g will clean up your dependencies/directives

Work with Rich and Andy

class name must match file name
to be attached to a sript, must be attached to another class : MonoBehaviour
custom classes must be serialized

serialized - 
    - if contained in just one script, serialize (like in prefabs)
    - essentially just brings the field into the Unity view (click and drag references)
    - for base class
    It means it's exposed in Inspector AND the value its set to will be saved in the scene file.

alt click
alct cntr click for multiline editing

shift enter to return without sending in mattermost
