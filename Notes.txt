Space Camp - 

Waterfall vs agile
    Waterfall - sequential design process, each phase started and completed and then move onto next one, can't go back after done. Meticulous documentation. 
    Agile - develop software incrementally, work on small modules, design test deploy then get feedback, and redesign... allows for rapid change. Versions can be launched periodically
Waterfall needs the picture known at the start of the project

the agile manifesto
flat organization (watch out for power hides, loudes voice prevails, blurred boundaries)

UI/UX - user interface and user experience

EXTREME PROGRAMMING
    - TDD
    - Pair programming
    - MVP
lightewight, humanistic, discipline, software development
Developing is like driving, change
mentality of sufficiency
Values and Principles
    - communication
    - simplicity
    - feedback
    - courage

1. incremental planning     - user stories, break stories into tasks, plan release, develop integrate, test, release software, evaluate and iterate
2. small releases           - value, constant feedback, sense of accomplishment, quickly adapt to changing requirements
3. simple design            - enough to meet the requirements, fewest possible classes and methods, 
4. test first               - all features need tests first, 1. create unit tests, write code to meet the test
5. refactoring              - take suboptimal code and restructure to make it simple and maintainable
6  pair programming         - 2 people, programming and strategizing
7. continuous integration   - integration testing every few hours, cycle, programming - local tests - integrate (integration tests) - system tests
8. on-site customer         - 

User stories - INVEST 
    independent
    negotiable
    valuable
    estimable
    sized
    testable

    Linear weighting - 0,1,2,3

Platform One - deployment platform (seperate organization)
Continuous authority to operate, certificat to field, pipelines, security standards,

Testing is through Jest






Anderson Pickney and Richard Hardy (shadow today) - Unity part


Jerimiah - server
Ryan and Zach - server connecting to client
Unified Data Library - where data is pulled from

AppModel - stores most of the satellite data on front end

shortcuts ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
f12 to go to document of a classes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Unity - has its own test runner, 
    write tests in unity, 
    linting (re-sharper) good syntax in code
    sonarcube (docker stuff) 

edit mode - tests run while game not playing
play mode - tests run while game is playing





private _someThing
protected  - backing field MaxSatCount .... protected should have it's own properties

field vs property
public is usually a property

Confluence - Claire

cycling through orbit states? different observations?
I is for interfaces
    interface can be put on anything
ex: public class Appmodel : Window
    Window has a public interface lskdjfasdlj : lsdfjlkj {}

show advances in launches (videos old to new), but why are our operators ....
show new operational software
